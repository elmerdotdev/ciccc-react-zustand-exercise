# E-0923 React Zustand Exercise

1. Create a React project called 'zustand-practice'. Make sure you are in the dev branch
2. Create a store called userStore that has these states:
*firstname (string)*
*lastname (string)*
*age (number)*
*hobbies (array)*
*setFirstname (function)*
*setLastname (function)*
3. In your User component, output all the states. Use map for the hobbies since it's an array
4. Create a form with two input fields (one for firstname and one for lastname)
5. Clicking the submit button will update the firstname and lastname states in your Zustand store
6. Push your final code and create a pull request from dev to master to merge
